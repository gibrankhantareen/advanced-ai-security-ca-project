# Advanced AI Home Security System by Gibran Khan Tareen

This project has been done as part of my course for the CSE at Lovely Professional University . Supervised by Sagar Pande, I had three months to fulfill the requirements in order to succeed the module. Since my very start, I have been extremely interested in everything which is related to Artificial Intelligence. This project was a great occasion to give me the time to learn and confirm my interest for this field. The fact that I can use AI in the field of Security as well and using by additional AI concepts helped me more to enhance my interest in the field of Artficial Intelligence. That’s why I decided to have my project around Artificial Intelligence

I my hope that this document will be of huge help to every AI Enthusiast. I have used a different AI approach while coding my project which has proved to be very beneficial for me and it has been designed in such a way that it is easy to understand if you want to grasp knowledge of Artificial Intelligence. After the formulation and continuous evaluation of all of my test cases I have reached the maximum accuracy of 95% Home Security Analysis but I will will work even more to increase this accuracy to 100% Inshallah.

IMPORTANT: Refer to the Workflow-Flowchart image of my Project to understand its Functioning
