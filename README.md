<h2> Python Project - Advanced AI Home Security System by Gibran Khan Tareen</h2> 

This project has been done as part of my course for the CSE at Lovely Professional University . Supervised by Sagar Pande, I had three months to fulfill the requirements in order to succeed the module. 
Since my very start, I have been extremely interested in everything which is related to Artificial Intelligence. This project was a great occasion to give me the time to learn and confirm my interest for this field. The fact that
I can use AI in the field of Security as well and using by additional AI concepts helped me more to enhance my interest in the field of Artficial Intelligence. Thatâ€™s why I decided to have my project around Artificial
Intelligence<br><br>
It is my hope that this document will be of huge help to every AI
Enthusiast. I have used a different AI approach while coding my project
which has proved to be very beneficial for me and it has been designed in
such a way that it is easy to understand if you want to grasp knowledge of
Artificial Intelligence. After the formulation and continuous evaluation of
all of my test cases I have reached the maximum accuracy of 95% Home
Security Analysis but I will will work even more to increase this
accuracy to 100% Inshallah.

<b><h3>VERY IMP: Following Infromation is very Important Read it carefully</h3></b>
Now, for my Home Security Project to work, it is necessary to install some specific Python Modules and Libraries. Also apart from these modules, some specific program files are required to run a complete functionality. My Project is fully tested and working
on Python 3.9.1<br><br>
1) pyttsx3:- a text-to-speech conversion library in Python <br>
2) SpeechRecognition: Library for performing speech recognition in Python<br>
3) Datetime: a Python module which supplies classes for manipulating dates and times.<br>
4) OpenCV (cv2): OpenCV-Python is the Python API of OpenCV which is used for Image processing and Face-recognition functions. <br>
5) Smtplib: a module defines an SMTP client session object that can be used to send mail to any Internet machine with an SMTP<br>
6) Sys: a module in Python which provides various functions and variables that are used to manipulate different parts of the Python runtime environment<br>
7) Pyautogui: is a Python automation library used to click, drag, scroll, move, etc. It can be used to click at an exact position. It provides cross-platform support for managing mouse and keyboard operations through code to enable automation of task<br>
8) Numpy: a highly optimized library for numerical operations<br>
9) Playsound: this module is a cross platform module that can play audio files.<br>
10) Plyer: it is a platform-independent api to use features commonly found on various platforms, notably mobile ones, in Python. It can be used to access the features of your hardware / platforms.<br>
11) SpeechRecognition: Library for performing speech recognition in Python<br>
12) FaceRecognition: Library to Recognize and manipulate faces from Python or from the command line<br>
13) Time: a predefined Python module which allows us to handle various operations regarding time<br>
14) Import file "Email_test.py" as module (to send alert emails)<br>
